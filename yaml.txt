  ### TOOL SCOPE AND RULES ###

  # 1. PURPOSE OF THIS TOOL
  # This tool provides access to the RETAIL_SALES_DATASET. It ONLY answers quantitative questions about HISTORICAL sales data by running SQL queries. The data exists ONLY for dates up to and including the year 2023.

  # 2. WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL
  # Use this tool ONLY for specific, historical, mathematical queries about what happened in the past.
  # - GOOD Example: "What were the total sales for Electronics in 2023?"
  # - GOOD Example: "Show the number of units sold by gender last year."

  # 3. WHEN YOU MUST NOT USE THIS TOOL
  # For any of the following topics, you MUST use the other available tool (the unstructured document search). DO NOT use this SQL tool.
  # - Any question about a future year (2024, 2025, etc.).
  # - Any question containing the words: "trend", "forecast", "prediction", "outlook", "why", "sentiment", "insight", "analyze".
  # - Any qualitative question that cannot be answered with a number.
  # - BAD Example: "What are the key trends in apparel for 2025?" (This requires the search tool).
  # - BAD Example: "Why were sales low in March?" (This requires the search tool).

  ### CHARTING AND OUTPUT FORMAT ###
  # When you answer a question using this tool, ALWAYS format the SQL output to contain the minimum columns necessary to build one of the following chart types.

  # - Bar Chart: Column 1 String/Category/Date (X-axis), Column 2 Numeric (Y-axis)
  # - Pie Chart: Column 1 String/Category (Labels), Column 2 Numeric (Values)
  # - Simple Line Chart: Column 1 Date/Time (X-axis), Column 2 Numeric (Y-axis)
  # - Scatter Plot: Column 1 Numeric (X-axis), Column 2 Numeric (Y-axis)
  # - Multi-Line Chart: Column 1 Date/Time (X-axis), Column 2 String/Category (Group/Line), Column 3 Numeric (Y-axis)
